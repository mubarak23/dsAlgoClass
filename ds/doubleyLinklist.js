// add a pointer to the previous node and the next node
// each node point in two direction
// Every node has another pointer, to the previous node
// the start node has no previous node, but has next node
// the last node on the list has previous node but does not has the next node
// we have to count for next and previous everytime we add or remove something in the lists
// more memory which give us more flexibility
